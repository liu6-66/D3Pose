# D3Pose - Double-Masked Encoder-Decoder model for video mesh recovery 

This research project aims to beat SOTA models on video mesh recovery with a novel cross-attention transformer-based model.

## Usage

install the following dependencies

```bash
CLIP

```

## Pipeline

![Pipeline](assets/picture1.png)
Inspired by the [vanilla transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) in NLP. This paper utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture to strengthen temporal smoothness. The vanilla self-attention module is replaced by the swin transformer module.
